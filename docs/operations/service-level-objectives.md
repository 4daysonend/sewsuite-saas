# SewSuite Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the SewSuite application, including Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).

## Availability SLOs

| Service Component | Target Availability | Measurement Method | Reporting Frequency |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Frontend Application | 99.95% | CloudWatch synthetic canaries | Daily |
| Backend API | 99.99% | CloudWatch alarms on 5xx errors | Daily |
| Database | 99.99% | RDS monitoring | Daily |
| Object Storage | 99.99% | S3 metrics | Weekly |

## Performance SLOs

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Frequency |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| API Response Time (P95) | < 300ms | CloudWatch custom metrics | Hourly |
| Page Load Time (P95) | < 2s | CloudFront metrics | Daily |
| Database Query Time (P95) | < 100ms | RDS Performance Insights | Daily |
| Image Upload Time (P95) | < 3s | Custom application metrics | Daily |

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| Disaster Scenario | RTO | Validation Method |
|-------------------|-----|------------------|
| Database Corruption | 1 hour | Monthly restore test |
| Application Deployment Failure | 15 minutes | Every deployment |
| AWS Region Outage | 4 hours | Bi-annual DR test |
| Accidental Data Deletion | 2 hours | Quarterly restore test |
| Security Incident | 4 hours | Annual security exercise |

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Data Type | RPO | Backup Method |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| Database | 5 minutes | Transaction logs + Automated snapshots |
| User Files | 1 hour | S3 cross-region replication |
| Application Code | 0 (zero) | Git + ECR image immutability |
| Configuration | 1 hour | Automated config backups |

## Error Budget

The SewSuite application has a monthly error budget based on our SLO targets:

- 99.95% availability = 21.9 minutes downtime per month
- Error budget reset: First day of each month
- Error budget policy: If >50% of error budget is consumed in the first half of the month, new feature deployments will be paused in favor of reliability improvements

## Monitoring and Alerting

| SLO | Alert Threshold | Alert Channel |
|-----|-----------------|--------------|
| API Success Rate | < 99.9% over 5 minutes | PagerDuty (urgent) |
| API Latency | P95 > 500ms over 10 minutes | Slack #alerts (warning) |
| Database Connectivity | Any failures over 1 minute | PagerDuty (urgent) |
| Storage Availability | < 100% over 5 minutes | PagerDuty (urgent) |

## SLO Review Schedule

These SLOs will be reviewed quarterly to ensure they align with business requirements and technical capabilities.
